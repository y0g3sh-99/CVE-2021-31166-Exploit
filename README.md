# CVE-2021-31166-Exploit
Exploit for MS Http Protocol Stack RCE vulnerability (CVE-2021-31166)

A specially crafted Http request targetting a vulnerable windows version will result into DOS attack. And the server will be rebooted with blue screen error.
Http.sys is a windows kernel driver responsible for handling http requests and crafting a response for those.
This vulnerable http.sys driver can't handle crafted "Accept-Encoding" header, and gets crashed. Resultantly, the server will reboot.
On the blue screen, we can see error with "Stop Code: KERNEL SECURITY CHECK FAILED"

Vulnerable windows versions:
Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016 (20h2 and 2004 releases for both)
